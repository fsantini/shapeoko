G-codes supported by GRBL:

G-code	Meaning	Notes
G0/G00	Switch to rapid linear motion mode (seek)	Used to get the tool somewhere quickly without cutting
G1/G01	Switch to linear motion at the current feed rate	Used to cut a straight line
G2/G02	Switch to clockwise arc mode	
G3/G03	Switch to anti-clockwise arc mode	
G4/G04	Dwell (pause)	
G17	Select the XY plane (for arcs)	
G18	Select the XZ plane (for arcs)	
G19	Select the YZ plane (for arcs)	
G20	After this, units will be in inches	Best practice: do this at the start of a program and nowhere else
G21	After this, units will be in mm	Best practice: do this at the start of a program and nowhere else
G28	Return to home position	(to-do: compare with G30)
G30	Return to home position	(to-do: compare with G28)
G90	Switch to absolute distance mode	Coords are now relative to the origin of the currently active coordinate system (to-do: explain!)
G91	Switch to incremental distance mode	Coords are now relative to the current position
G92	Change the current coordinates without moving	e.g. "G92 x0 y0 z0" makes the current position the home position
G93	Set inverse time feed rate mode	(to-do: find out what that means)
G94	Set units per minute feed rate mode	(to-do: find out what that means)
